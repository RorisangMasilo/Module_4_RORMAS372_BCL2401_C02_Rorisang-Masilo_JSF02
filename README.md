### Introduction

Welcome to the Vue E-commerce site! This project is a web application designed to showcase products in a user-friendly manner. It features a detailed view modal to display comprehensive product information, including product images, ratings, and descriptions.

### Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling the components.
- Vue.js: Handling state and interactivity in a lightweight manner.
- Tailwind CSS: CSS styling.
- JavaScript: Functionality and content handling.

1. Clone the Repository
2. Project directory - cd SwiftCart
3. Install the required dependencies using npm install
4. To run project use npm run dev

### Reflections

#### Areas of Improvement

- Styling aspects: Styling aspects of the projects, including Tailwind CSS require myself to have an understanding of the complexity of styling with such a tool.
- Javascript: My Javascript knowledge in the project revealed that I may lack in the knowledge of the technology or language especially in the functionality and interrelated relationship of components

#### Struggle Points

- Functionality capability: Ensure features or components such as the SortFilter.vue, was quite difficult to implement.
